<h1>Scraw</h1>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p>
This is a random stroke. Your stroke is decomposed in different segments and each one are deformed randomly.
</p>
<h3> Options </h3>

<p>
<em>Noise</em> : amplitude of a deformation in a segment.
</p>
<p>
<em>Details</em> : number of deformations for one segment.
</p>
<p>
<em>Flow</em> : segment frequency.
Short flow means a short and more deformed segments for the same details value.
</p>

<em>Fill mode</em> : Yes.

<string name="descr_web_brush"><![CDATA[
<h1>Web brush</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This stroke is composed of small straight lines.
