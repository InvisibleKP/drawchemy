<h1>Colors</h1>
<h3> Main and secondary colors </h3>
<p> On the top left in the Action bar (top bar), there are two colored circles : one big and one small.
They are respectively the main and the secondary color.
If you click on the secondary color, it will become the main one and the previous main the secondary.

<h3>Go to the color user interface</h3>
<p>You can either go to the color user interface by clicking on the main color circle or on Colors in the menu.</p>
<h3> Hue noise </h3>
If hue noise is enabled, your stroke will not use the main and secondary color but colors
with the same saturation and brightness but a different hue. The hue is chosen randomly.
The slide bar under the hue noise check box parameterize how far the random hue can differ from the original hue.
